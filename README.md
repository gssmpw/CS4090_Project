## Project Description
This is a full-stack software development project with the intention of developing a group scheduling service that allows users to view their upcoming events without the obstruction of events unrelated to them.

### User Role Descriptions
Users will be split into one of 4 roles - Event Organizer, Regular Member, Cross-Group Collaborator, and Faculty Advisor.

Event Organizers are responsible for creating and editing groups, adding new users to existing groups, and creating and editing new and existing events.

Regular Users are the default user, having the least amount of access the the service. These users can view their associated events, as well as receive notifications when events are created or edited.

Cross-Group Collaborators are similar to Regular Users, the sole difference being that they are associated with more than one event group.

Faculty Advisors act as Regular Users or Cross-Group Collaborators, but have administrative control to approve or deny new events when created by Event Organizers.
